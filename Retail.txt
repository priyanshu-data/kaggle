This particular dataset is of the retail shops,where we have distinguished the regions with some numbers.
Our role is to make reports on the transactions,what are the inferences that we can make so that the shops can manage their assets,make some 
graphical representation on the data set for the ease of the owners.

Also ,sort the data in a particular way where a non data science background can be able to understand with ease.

If possible make predictions so that the owners can make some future assumptions,which can make business profitable,or they can find a way to 
tackle the situation.

This particular case study is a well designed dataset for the practice.
